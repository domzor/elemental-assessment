# Elemental Assessment

[View Online](https://domzor.github.io/elemental-assessment/)

This test took around 4 hours to complete. The slider gave me a bit more trouble than I expected and there are a few changes I would make to get it 100% how I want it, but it functions as it should. The styling could also do with some more cleaning up.

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Run locally using live-server.

### `gulp watch`

Watch for .scss changes and compile on save. Requires [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).
